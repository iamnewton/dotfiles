# üõ† dotfiles(1)

A highly-configurable, cross-platform `dotfiles` setup built with:

- ‚úÖ Idempotent, modular shell scripts
- üê≥ Docker test harness
- üß™ Bash-based assertions
- üì¶ Easy packaging
- ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Actions CI ready

Typically software you buy comes with some sort of installer, why not your dotfiles? After manually setting up my dotfiles and installation for years, I decided to take a page from [some](https://github.com/necolas) [other](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) [people's](https://github.com/cowboy) [books](http://dotfiles.github.io) and set up a script that will configure my machine to setup my bash profile and install a few core packages.  Feel free to [poke around](https://github.com/iamnewton/dotfiles/commits/main) the repository, [fork it](https://github.com/iamnewton/dotfiles/fork) to make it your own, [suggest things](https://github.com/iamnewton/dotfiles/issues?labels=feature+request) for me to include, [log a bug](https://github.com/iamnewton/dotfiles/issues/new), or maybe checkout the [features list](#features) to see what's included.

## Installation

:warning: This will overwrite existing dotfiles in your `$HOME` directory.

```bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -#fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamnewton/dotfiles/main/bin/install)"
```

### Requirements

Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your system.  If you're on MacOS then you already have these, but a Linux system may not come with all.

* [curl](http://curl.haxx.se)
* [git](http://git-scm.com)

:exclamation: N.B. If you wish to [fork this project](https://github.com/iamnewton/dotfiles/fork) and maintain your own dotfiles, you **MUST** substitute my username for your own in the above command and the variable (`$USERNAME`) found at the top of the `bin/install.sh` script.

## Features

Besides some [custom bash prompts](#shell-custom-bash-prompt), there are some [&lt;tab&gt; completion libraries](https://github.com/iamnewton/dotfiles/wiki/-tab--Completion) installed as well.

### Custom bash prompt

A custom bash prompt based on the [Seti UI color palette](https://github.com/jesseweed/seti-ui) and influenced by [@necolas](https://github.com/necolas), [@gf3](https://github.com/gf3) and [@cowboy](https://github.com/cowboy) custom prompts. When your current working directory is a Git repository, the `$PROMPT` will display the checked-out branch's name (and failing that, the commit SHA that `HEAD` is pointing to). The state of the working tree is reflected in the following way:

| Symbol | Meaning                          |
| :----: | :------------------------------- |
| +      | Uncommitted changes              |
| !      | Unstaged changes                 |
| ?      | Untracked files                  |
| $      | Stashed files                    |

For best results with iTerm, you should install [the SETI color scheme for iTerm](https://github.com/willmanduffy/seti-iterm). Further details are in the `./conf/bash_prompt` file.

### Local/private configuration

Any private and custom Bash commands and configuration should be placed in a `$HOME/.bash_profile.local` file. This file will not be under version control or committed to a public repository. If `$HOME/.bash_profile.local` exists, it will be sourced for inclusion in `bash_profile`. The same goes for any local Git configuration but within the `$HOME/.gitconfig.local`

Here is an example `~/.bash_profile.local`:

```bash
# Github Issues library token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="<insert github token>"

# Aliases
alias code="cd ~/Code"
```

## Request Support

If you have a question about this project, how to use it, or need clarification about something:

1. Open a [support request](https://github.com/iamnewton/dotfiles/issues/new?template=support_request.md) or reach out via [email](mailto:holocron77@gmail.com).
2. Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
3. Provide library version and/or platform versions (Linux, MacOS, etc), depending on what seems relevant. If not, please be ready to provide that information if maintainers ask for it.

If you chose to write an issue, once it's filed:

* The team will [label the issue](./MAINTAINING.md#label-issues).
* Someone will try to respond as soon as possible, generally within 48 hours.
* If you or the maintainers don't respond to an issue for 30 days, the [issue will be closed](./MAINTAINING.md#clean-up-issues-and-prs). If you want to come back to it, reply (once, please), and we'll reopen the existing issue. Please avoid filing new issues as extensions of one you already made.

If you chose to ask us a question, then ask a quality question:

Help us help you!

Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it much easier for us to help.  It’s common to fall into the trap of asking something too specific when you’re close to a problem.  Then, those trying to help you out have to spend a lot of time asking additional questions to understand what you are hoping to achieve.

Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.

* Try to define what you need help with:
  * Is there something in particular you want to do?
  * What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try and fix it?
  * Is there a concept you’re not understanding?
* Learn about the [rubber duck debugging method](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/).
* Avoid falling for the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378).
* Search on GitHub and Slack to see if a similar question has been asked
* If possible, provide sample code, a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or a video
* The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you

## Report an Error or Bug

If you run into an error or bug with the project:

1. Open a [bug report](https://github.com/iamnewton/dotfiles/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
2. Fill out the template and provide as much context as you can about what you're running into and be sure to include steps **to reproduce** such that someone else can follow to recreate the bug or error on their own.
4. Provide project and platform versions (Linux, MacOS, etc), depending on what seems relevant. If not, please be ready to provide that information if maintainers ask for it.

Once it's filed:

* The team will [label the issue](./CONTRIBUTING.md#label-issues).
* A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no obvious ways to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-clarification`. Bugs with the `needs-clarification` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
* If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](https://github.com/iamnewton/dotfiles/graphs/contributors).
* If you or the maintainers don't respond to an issue for 30 days, the [issue will be closed](./MAINTAINING.md#clean-up-issues-and-prs). If you want to come back to it, reply (once, please), and we'll reopen the existing issue. Please avoid filing new issues as extensions of one you already made.
* `critical` issues may be left open, depending on perceived immediacy and severity, even past the 30 day deadline.

## Request a Feature

If the project doesn't do something you need or want it to do:

1. Open a [feature request](https://github.com/iamnewton/dotfiles/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)
2. Fill out the template and provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
3. Please try and be clear about why existing features and alternatives would not work for you.

Once it's filed:

* The team will [label the issue](./MAINTAINING.md#label-issues).
* The project team will evaluate the feature request, possibly asking you more questions to understand its purpose and any relevant requirements. If the issue is closed, the team will convey their reasoning and suggest an alternative path forward.
* If the feature request is accepted, it will be marked for implementation with `feat`, which can then be done by either by a core team member or by anyone in the community who wants to [contribute code](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

:notebook_with_decorative_cover: The team is unlikely to be able to accept every single feature request that is filed. Please understand if they need to say no.

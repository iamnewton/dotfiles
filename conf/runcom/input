# Although the Readline library comes with a set of default keybindings,
# it is possible to modify these by putting commands into a .inputrc file,
# typically in the home directory. The name of this file is taken from the
# value of the shell variable INPUTRC. If that variable is unset, the
# default is ~/.inputrc If that file does not exist or cannot be read, the
# ultimate default is /etc/inputrc
#
# The configuration options in .inputrc are particularly useful for
# customising the way Tab-completion works, e.g. with the ls command
#
# When a program which uses the Readline library starts up, the init file
# is read, and the key bindings are set. In addition, the C-x C-r command
# re-reads this init file, thus incorporating any changes that you might
# have made to it.
